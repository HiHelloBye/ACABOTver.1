# ACABOT ver.1

**Auto Classification Album Based On TensorFlow**

ACABOT is a mobile application that automatically classifies a user's photo library into predefined categories and recommends hashtags based on the image content.

Developed as a graduation project, this version utilizes Objective-C and TensorFlow to implement deep learning-based photo classification on iOS devices.

## Features
- Automatically classify unorganized photos into default categories (Human, Animal, Food, Landscape, Concert, etc.)
- Recommend hashtags based on photo analysis
- Organize and display photos within categorized albums
- Efficient management without additional device storage usage

## Technologies Used
- Objective-C
- TensorFlow
- iOS SDK (UIKit)

## Project Background
ACABOT ver.1 was developed to solve the problem of disorganized photo libraries by leveraging deep learning.  
While TensorFlow provided accurate image classification, it also resulted in larger app size and slower performance on mobile devices, leading to the motivation for the Swift + CoreML reimplementation in ACABOT ver.2.
